# please-vim
A vim plugin for please

## Requirements
At the moment this depends on google/vim-maktaba, but ultimately I don't think it should so I'll probably rip it out

## Installation
Install with your favourite package manager

## Usage
`:Please <some please command>` to invoke please

`:PleaseBuildThis` picks up the word under the cursor, generates a complete build label, and builds it
